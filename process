run main
    - parses the data
    - parses the questions
    - sends test email with some info about the secret santa event
    - allows removal of bounced emails
    - creates the santa files and master list
        - done last so only files of valid users are made


run santaEmailer
    - sends the final emails with secret santa detail files



Python Plan: 

    - make 1 main file and abstract certain features into their own files and import them
    - add if name main for testing to each module 
    - have a config file so don't have to ask for bunch of stuff
    - verify config file is filled out in main before calling any module functions
    - keep menu system from cpp version

    Modules:
        - data parser, does both websurvey data and questions
        - emailer, does test and final
        - santa generator, shuffles santas and generates the files (santa files and master files/list)
        - something for removing? or add to data parser?
